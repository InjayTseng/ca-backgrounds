      rule: 'Each cell looks at three cells — left, self, right — and consults an 8-row lookup table. All 256 possible rules fit in one byte; rule 110 is one of them, and it is provably Turing-complete.',
      why: 'The background is a spacetime diagram scrolling upward: compute one row per frame, push it up. One-dimensional means absurdly cheap; deterministic means it never dies and never explodes — it just keeps generating. Watch rule 110 long enough and you see gliders colliding on a periodic ether: it is, quite literally, a machine.',
      dies: 'Almost never. 90 grows a Sierpinski fractal from a single seed; 30 grows a chaotic triangle (which wraps, self-collides, and turns into full-width turbulence); 110 and 184 start from a random row.

      why: "A classic with one fatal flaw as a background: random soup settles into still lifes and oscillators within a few hundred generations. Two rescues here: every cell leaves a decaying trail (history stays visible), and every few seconds a glider flies in from an edge with a splash of soup. Day & Night is far more active if you'd rather not feed it.",
      dies: 'Yes. A watchdog reseeds when activity drops below threshold or stalls for 60 generations; between rescues, the glider rain keeps it alive.',

    concept: {
      rule: 'k colours arranged in a ring. A cell advances to the next colour when enough neighbours already hold it. That is the whole rule — no birth, no death. Range, threshold and colour count decide whether it grows spirals or turbulence.',
      why: "From noise it passes through three phases: debris → droplets (locally synchronised patches swallowing each other) → spirals (topological defects that sustain their own wave sources). Once a spiral forms it turns forever — exactly what a background wants: motion without an ending. It is the leanest discrete excitable medium after Greenberg–Hastings, made famous when Dewdney covered Griffeath's experiments in Scientific American in 1989.",
      dies: 'No. Spirals are topological defects; nothing short of outside interference removes them.',
      cost: 'O(cells × neighbourhood) per frame at 4px cells. The R3 Moore neighbourhood is 48 cells and JavaScript still keeps up.',

      rule: "Every bird sees only the neighbours within a radius and does three things: don't collide (separation), match heading (alignment), drift toward the centre (cohesion). No leader, no global information. The window is a glass tank: birds bank away as they near a wall, and bounce off it if they still arrive.",
      why: 'From grid to agents: the rules stay local, but the substrate becomes moving individuals. Flocks, schools and crowd evacuations all run on this. As a background it is the safest of the six — it neither converges nor explodes — just keep speed and density low so it does not steal attention.',
      dies: 'No. But too many birds plus too much cohesion will clump into a blob.',

      why: 'The most alive-looking thing on this list: soft-bodied creatures glide across the grid carrying their own anatomy, orbiting and swallowing one another. The blur, the glow, the slowness a background wants — Lenia has them natively. The price is mortality: two creatures collide and dissolve into mist. Hence the watchdog: when total mass drops, a new creature is dropped into empty space; when a collision blows up into a labyrinth, the grid reseeds. Flow Lenia (2023) fixes this at the root with mass conservation.',

      why: "Every other tab runs rules a human wrote; this one runs rules that were learned — and the training target is a steady state, so it doesn't die, doesn't explode, and repairs itself. Wipe a patch away and watch it regrow. It is a toy version of the morphogenesis Levin talks about, on a 64×64 grid — and the one background nobody else can ship, because the weights are yours.",
